The Environmental Health Officer will however carry out a Financial Test of resources to determine how much , if anything , you are expected to pay towards the reasonable costs . He/she will tell you how much this is at the @beginning@ so you know at the start how much you have to pay . You will then need to gather together the necessary things to make an application . How do I raise the money I am to pay ?

Incipient spins Any time that a wing @begins@ to drop at a stall it is the beginning of a possible spin , but the spin can only develop if the wing is kept stalled and the glider is allowed to continue to yaw . In the UK there has been much discussion about teaching stall recoveries with a view to making it all easier for the beginner to understand and remember . It has been suggested that incipient is an unfamiliar word , that associating the stall with a spin might get the student worried , and that to simplify things we should only talk about stalls and spins .
begin.v 0 0 1 0 0 @ Such material clearly illustrates the new modes of thought we were developing . Our new semantic understanding was therefore linked to the changing epiphenomena of dress , hair , clothing , and the other symbols of the body I have mentioned ; but it was also manifest in an irrepressible need to reinterpret and question the social condition , for I had journeyed beyond the norms of the police system , where action to control is preferably a simple matter of enforcing the rules and regulations as they stand . Yet this move into anti - structure was merely @beginning@ . The unconventional , questioning form I had begun to pursue was rewarded by an invitation in 1972 to attend United Nations European Social Affairs Division in Geneva . Experts from a variety of European agencies were brought together to discuss and report on the various cross - cultural attitudes to drug - taking among young people .

The Duke held up his branch like a banner and @began@ to lead the way along to the east gate , but a large part of the crowd stayed in a half - circle round the group at the table , as though waiting for the victor 's crow in the cockfight . Clear the grounds ! the factor was shouting . Clear the grounds !

She @began@ to shed the brilliant borrowed chameleon plumage , she wanted to let Lucy in . She started on her flesh . Jay was a solid woman , dressed in dark loose comfortable clothes that hid a multitude of sins .

I was particularly impressed by the way you managed to organise all the available services so efficiently just at the time when we were @beginning@ to wonder how we 'd manage . Dr S J Bowcock Former Senior Registrar in Haematology , Hammersmith Hospital I would like to thank you and your Team for all the effort and resources you have put into providing a home care service for our patients .

It is a case which , I am afraid to tell you , has its own beginning and middle and alas an end too . Here , Mrs Pettifer @began@ to interject but the small gentleman silenced her with a flap of the wrist which was altogether not very gentlemanly and proved too much for the great lady detective who made a more purposeful interjection of her own . This is very interesting , she said , but I 'm afraid that it is nothing more than a performance . It is a very clever performance what they call in theatrical circles a beautiful performance .
