bank.n 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 @ The saving on interest rate costs by taking out a foreign currency mortgage is obvious enough about 5 per cent to 6 per cent . The big pitfall is the prospect of a currency loss if sterling declines still further , which can wipe out the benefit of interest rate savings and leave the borrower owing more debt than he borrowed in the first place . Because of this , foreign currency mortgages , which are being sold very heavily at the moment by financial intermediaries ( linked to @banks@ and other financial institutions which are providing the funds ) , are only for the financially sophisticated . There are ways of hedging against the exchange rate risk . One method is to switch the foreign currency loan back into sterling if you think that sterling will weaken significantly more than a possibility .

The Exchange intends that the new clearing house will be jointly owned . The Exchange will hold around 40 per cent of the shares in the new body with 20 or more groups such as @banks@ , registrars , securities houses and large financial institutions as well as some listed companies holding the remainder . As yet nothing is concrete and , following Sir Geoffrey 's study , that initial concept may well change . The terms of reference of Sir Geoffrey 's committee indicate that the Exchange is determined that all aspects of the creation of a clearing house are fully explored .

It may be that you choose to obtain a mortgage , second mortgage or a loan from a @bank@ . If you feel that you will be unable to take out a loan in this way or that it will cause you financial hardship , you can apply to the Social Services Department for help . They will ask you further information about your finances and/or your situation and may then in certain circumstances by able to offer you a loan .
bank.n 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 @ Eurotunnel 's bankers are therefore putting increasing pressure on Alastair Morton , British co - chairman of the project , to raise significant new equity . It will not be easy for him to do so . Yet , if he refuses , or if he fails in any attempt , the @banks@ could , in theory , take over the company which is in default of several loan agreements . Mr Morton and his colleagues will have to answer some awkward questions , not least from small investors , many of whom bought into the company attracted by the perks and the sense of excitement as much as by a detailed understanding of the economics of the enterprise . They will want to know how Eurotunnel got its sums so badly awry .

Also , investment patterns in both parts of Ireland are increasingly similar , being a mixture of British , international , local , and cross - border companies . Internal commerce , from heavy machinery to domestic goods , largely ignores the border , and the high street @banks@ are the same throughout Ireland . The main economic differences reflect the different structures of the state and the different state policies adopted by the British and Irish governments at any one time , though with a significantly higher state sector of employment in Ulster . There is likewise considerable overlap in cultural areas .

Instead , he was living in a north London flat and working weekdays in a City @bank@ , returning home at night to a difficult marriage . London itself , however , may have furnished encouragement for the lines Eliot 's thought was taking . Visiting the Notting Hill Victorian mansion of Ford Madox Ford , Eliot saw not quite a sacred grove , but a patch of grass surmounted by Gaudier - Brzeska 's Hieratic Head of Ezra Pound which Wyndham Lewis described as Ezra in the form of a marble phallus .

The following demonstration compares a stall with a little too much rudder to a stall in a slightly slipping turn , and shows how even slightly too much rudder has a significant effect at the stall . Start to circle in a normal turn with about 20 of @bank@ , keeping the yaw string exactly in the middle while you reduce speed very gradually . ( On most types of training glider it will be possible to get down to the pre - stall buffet and continue with either a slight rocking of the wings or a very gentle inner wingdrop . ) Keep the rudder where it is and allow the speed to increase a few knots so that both you and the student can observe the exact position of the rudder pedals .

Bob Maiden , the managing director , said the range was a response to the many requests from staff for something to wear which can be identified with the @bank@ . Three top designers were approached at an undisclosed cost . The result is a range by Paul Costelloe which RBS hopes will lead to a harmonious look among the staff .

bank.n 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 @ Now , the Talleyrand - Perigords have , as their name implies , been mighty lords in Perigord since the early Middle Ages , and in the early poem Near Perigord Talleyrand is one of the powerful and menacing neighbours whom Bertrand de Born has to play off one against another , thus earning ( so Pound 's poem suggests ) the title which Dante gives him in the Inferno , sower of strife . The chteau of Chalais has been a stronghold of the Talleyrands from that day to this , and when Pound in recent years read about Napoleon 's grand chamberlain , notably in the memoirs of Madame de Rmusat ( a principal source for Canto 101 ) , this new association with Chalais re - activated his memories of that place , which accordingly is named afresh , bringing Aubeterre with it , but in a quite different tone and spirit from to set here the roads of France . The trees that line the @banks@ , mostly willows are still there , and there are places in the town of Chalais crouched underneath its chteau , where Pound might still creep over old rafters in search of a stream full of lilies . Pound seems to have misremembered , however , for at Chalais the river is not the Dronne but a smaller stream , the Tude . And although the Tude has plants in its waters , I am reluctant to believe that any of them are lilies ; for Chalais has suffered from the twentieth century as Aubeterre has not , and the Tude is polluted whereas the Dronne runs clear .
