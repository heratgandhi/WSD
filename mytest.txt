Standard T - squares and the specials for perspective drawing boards ( WW/May 83 ) can be @produced@ in this way , as can longer straight - edges . There is little point in making the normal 45 and the 30 deg/60 ; set squares . However , a number of specials are worth making .
produce.v 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 @ In the notebooks Shatov ( as Shaposhnikov ) calls Slavophilism a gentleman 's fancy . We are back in the area of Peter the Great 's reforms . Peter tried to rouse his countrymen from their aboriginal stupor and turn them into Europeans ; but a Russian is n't and ca n't be a German or a Frenchman , and the result of Peter 's efforts was to @produce@ an educated class who ca n't be Russians either . They can of course call themselves Slavophils , but that is to try and wish away Peter , to perform an act of mental regression , not to be a Russian . It is a paper act in a paper situation , inflammable and precarious .

Sauces cling more easily to complex - shaped pasta . For this reason , some of the pasta shapes from Valerio 's Olympia Group are @produced@ with brass extruders . This , according to the company , gives the pasta a home - made look and a porosity which allows better sauce absorption . Some shapes also have internal ridging , which aids uniform cooking .
produce.v 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 @ Erdinger says it uses more than 50 per cent wheat , but declines to be more specific . I will guess 5060 per cent . The brewery was founded in 1853 , started to make wheat beers in the 1890s , and has @produced@ nothing else since it came into its present ownership , the Brombach family , in 1935 . At the time , it was making 3,500 hectolitres a year . WHEN I first encountered South German wheat beers , in the early to mid 1960s , they were regarded as an old - fashioned , rustic style , favoured by old ladies with large hats .
produce.v 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 @ The Christian Council on Ageing ( CCoA ) is a national voluntary and inter - denominational organisation , inaugurated in 1982 , which believes that churches should give greater attention to the particular needs and potential of older people . It sees the practical development of its work as taking place mainly at local level , and to this end encourages the formation of autonomous local groups which can respond to needs in their own area . The CCoA @produces@ a quarterly journal , Plus ; publishes occasional papers ; runs courses ; and promotes in - service training on ageing and pastoral care for clergy and pastoral workers . It is also currently developing devotional material for use in residential homes . Further information from CCoA Membership Secretary , 20 West Way , Rickmansworth , Hertfordshire , WD3 2EN .

Calibration The core is aligned with one coil picking up the north - south field and inclined at roughly 67 to the horizontal and adjusted so as to @produce@ the largest positive output from the amplifier . It is then rotated through approximately 180 degrees to find the largest negative output . This process is repeated , while the zero offset is adjusted , until the positive and negative readings have the same magnitude .

Don't expect to be selected on your first session ! The lite squads work more intensively and aim to @produce@ at least three prospective candidates in each weight division . More techniques are taught and there is ample opportunity to demonstrate your ability . After two or three such sessions , everyone 's performance is scrutinised and the leading contenders selected .

Four more drinkers @produced@ violent Technicolored Yawns long before reaching the eighth glass . As M'lud Beaumont intoned , drinking that amount of 2.2 is an uncomfortable process . Pass the sick bag , Alice Springs .
