party.n 0 0 0 1 0 0 @ Many speakers highlighted the apparent paradox of a party which gave its blessing to separate internal organisations for both women and young people , but which denied the same privilege to its black members . Mr Rogers , for the NEC , insisted that the leadership 's blueprint for black representation was a sincere attempt to resolve the issue . We have to recognise the strong feelings among black and white people that the @party@ should not set up an organisation which is racially exclusive , and could be seen as a form of apartheid .

Colleagues said last night that the speech marked a change of gear as Mr Kinnock moved away from @party@ organisation and policy and accelerated into the election campaign . Lord Callaghan , the last Labour prime minister , said : What happened in the 1980s was a temporary aberration from what has always been the real position of the Labour Party , and Neil Kinnock has recaptured the traditional position . But Mr Kinnock stressed in his speech that given the inevitable and unprecedented mess which would be left behind by Mrs Thatcher , a Labour government would have to set and unflinchingly stick to four basic priorities .

It showed just 25 minutes of the three - day World Cup in Barcelona ( the rest of its coverage was on Channel 4 ) . Bromley 's own leaving @party@ is scheduled for late autumn . Having been replaced as head of ITV 's sports committee by LWT 's controller of programmes , Greg Dyke , he is off to be chairman of TSL , an independent production company .

One was a dashing , debonair young man ; the other was a beautiful elegant girl with high cheek - bones and eyes of the purest grey . Hello auntie ! called the man as they neared the little @party@ . Hello uncle ! echoed the young woman in a foreign accented voice waving cheerily . Mon dieu ! said the little man , not apparently sure whether to be terribly angry or frightfully cross , Nicole !

In La Sylphide , James is seen dreaming in his farmhouse before La Sylphide awakens and dances with him. Later , apparently unseen by others , she dances through the betrothal @party@ at which he is confronted by Madge , the Witch , who foretells that he will never marry . He throws Madge from the room . In Giselle Albrecht

In these cases the interests of justice may demand special requirements such as , for example , that the preparation and presentation of the case be in separate and independent hands . In the second category , general civil cases , @parties@ should be able to choose their own lawyers because the interests of justice would be inherently less likely to fetter the client 's right of choice . Lord Donaldson implied , however , that solicitors who exercised their new rights of audience in these cases ought to be expected to concentrate on advocacy . While emphasising that he had not reached any firm conclusions , Lord Donaldson 's voice will be a powerful one in behind - the - scenes manoeuvres as rules governing the exercise of the new advocacy rights are hammered out away from the parliamentary battlefield .
