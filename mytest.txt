argument.n 0 1 0 0 0 1 @ He believes that literary study has a cultural and humane rather than an intellectual value ; and the implication of his recent work is that there are other ways of attaining cultural value . This has some affinity with the Marxist position . In a published @argument@ between Scholes and Hirsch , the former made the following statement , on the assumption that the conservative Hirsch would disagree with it : At the heart my belief is the conviction that no text is so trivial as to be outside the bounds of humanistic study . The meanest graffito , if fully understood , can be a treasure of human expressiveness
argument.n 0 0 1 0 0 1 @ If Bell is ruled out as too old and Ramsey as too new , who else has stature ? George Chase of Ripon , good as gold and wise as Solomon , but even shyer than Ramsey and without his intellectual bite ? Two other circumstances entered this prolonged @argument@ . These were hardly mentioned but underneath were not trivial . First , the York diocese had no desire for George Bell and every desire for Ramsey .
argument.n 0 0 1 0 0 0 @ Racing : Nisky to pass revision test By JOHN KARTER THE MISSING link reappears at Goodwood this afternoon in the shape of Ile De Nisky ( 2.45 ) , the horse who represents the prime piece of evidence in the @argument@ over the comparative merits of Nashwan and Old Vic , writes John Karter . The fact that the English and Irish Derby winners will never meet on the track does not stop the followers of the dynamic duo hammering home their cases . And if the form book is to be believed , Nashwan is clearly No. 1 because Ile De Nisky finished seven and a half lengths behind him at Epsom , but got a length nearer to Old Vic at The Curragh .
argument.n 0 0 1 0 1 0 @ In drawing attention to many such embarrassments , Davie 's book is sure to provoke a good deal of rancour in certain circles . Yet it would not be quite right to call Under Briggflatts controversial , for that deadened word implies a self - serving wish to shock which is far from Davie 's considered anger . And if Davie 's principles make him what some might call elitist or undemocratic , as in his stinging verdicts on catchpenny enterprises like the Arvon Poetry Competitions , it is not without his having pondered the @arguments@ about the place and function of elites and of high art in a democratic nation far more deeply than the bulk of his fellow countrymen . Just as importantly , he is possessed of a generosity of mind which allows him to be calmly judicious about the merits of writers who can advocate militant homosexuality and drug - taking ( such as Thom Gunn ) , sympathise with feminism ( Elaine Feinstein ) or adhere to some variant of Marxism ( Hugh MacDiarmid ) . Both in his sternness and in his generosity , Davie is strongly reminiscent of a much earlier writer , whose name is invoked towards the end of Under Briggflatts .
argument.n 0 0 1 0 0 0 @ Labour would be acquiescing in a democratic outrage if it continued arguing that , because the Conservatives had got away with being undemocratic for so long , it was now Labour 's turn . Mr Cook also countered the argument that PR would build in a pull towards the centre ground , preventing Labour from implementing a radical programme . It seemed strange to make that @argument@ , Mr Cook said , when it was clear the whole policy review process was designed to placate the centre ground . I cannot honestly see that a system which would require us to compromise the morning after the election is really so morally inferior to a system which has already obliged us to compromise our policies two years before polling day . His speech , however , came aftera 24 - 4 vote in the national executive to oppose a proportional representation motion which will be debated on Thursday .
argument.n 0 0 0 0 1 0 @ In front of a consequence so stark the deepest political thinkers recoiled . In the noble eloquence of his plea for conciliation with the colonists , Burke , who based his case on the proposition that they had not been represented at Westminster , drew a strange and illogical conclusion . His own @argument@ involved the admission that no common government , no common state , comprising both Great Britain and the colonies could subsist . Yet he proceeded to declare that by refraining from exercising in America the power of the executive which it controlled in Great Britain , Parliament would preserve the unity of the Empire : The more ardently they love liberty , the more perfect will be their obedience .
argument.n 0 0 0 0 1 0 @ A third effect which could be added is that business experience would be gained by the local merchant , and thus the society begins to develop a pool of people with such business experience . Experience of this nature may reduce the reliance of less developed countries on goods imported from abroad ; local manufacturers may be able to satisfy local market needs by intelligent marketing , and thus gain a larger share of the local market than before , with consequent results for local levels of production and the economy generally . A further element in this @argument@ is the possibility that advertising can be used as part of a marketing strategy to shape the wants and needs of a less developed society in a direction that is clearly beneficial . For instance , if a country concerned still employs traditional systems which , in the light of more modern techniques , appear to be detrimental to public health , it may be desirable to change patterns of behaviour in , say , nutrition or hygiene . Often this will not be successful if the population is attached to its traditional methods and the new methods are radically different from the old ; a careful marketing campaign to change attitudes can have a dramatic effect , particularly by presenting new products in a way that is not dramatically different from the old .
argument.n 0 0 0 0 1 0 @ We learn that climbing is about tenuous niches in the horizontal rather than scaling a sheer cliff , as the journalese has it . It 's about oases of control where there should be none . It should come as no surprise then , that some of those who see bolting as fundamentally reducing the experience I 've outlined above , and which is our common heritage , should cast around for some solid @arguments@ to counter its spread . Hence the great cry has gone up : Leave the environment alone ! What are a few bolts beside the environmental devastation caused by a large quarry ?
argument.n 0 0 0 0 0 1 @ But the declaration issued by the congress left no doubt that the decision was intended to be more than a mere facelift : The present concept of socialism , the Stalinist system , has exhausted all its social , economic , political and moral reserves , and has proved unsuitable for keeping pace with global developments . Thus the history of the HSWP as a state party has come to an end . To sidestep any @arguments@ about who should inherit the party 's vast fortunes if a split occurs , the delegates declared themselves to be the legal heirs of the HSWP , whilst dissociating themselves from the old party 's crimes , false and mistaken principles and methods . The founding document states that members of the old party will not automatically receive their new cards . They will all have to apply and sign the HSP 's statutes and programme .
argument.n 0 0 0 0 1 0 @ Not wanting to seem too negative , I have outlined ways in which the discipline of English as currently constituted might divide , to the benefit of both parties . But knowing how the academic mind works , I am not optimistic about change . As Noel Annan wrote in his life of Leslie Stephen : The ingenuity in @argument@ , the subtlety in drawing distinctions , the dexterous prevarications , the imperative reasons for procrastination , perpetually bewilder and confound the novice in university administration . In this respect , at least , little has altered since the nineteenth century . The most likely future is no overt change , with the discipline of English becoming less and less coherent , riven by feuds and revolts , but still presenting the external appearances of a large , well - established and respectable academic subject .
argument.n 0 0 1 0 0 0 @ CHINA increased its patrols along the border with Hong Kong yesterday in an apparent effort to prevent an exodus of its people into the colony following a dispute over immigration procedures . The dispute was triggered by Hong Kong 's decision to allow the top Chinese swimmer , Yang Yang , who had sought political asylum in the West , to travel to the US last week . However , the dispute reflects more the growing mistrust between the two sides rather than an @argument@ over visas and numbers . Hong Kong officials said negotiations with China to end the dispute were continuing and that the colony 's border guards were in a state of high alert in preparation for a possible influx . Police sources said China had doubled its patrol on the border .
